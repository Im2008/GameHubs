### GenomeGamers Frontend & Backend Repositories
- [Frontend Repository](https://github.com/Prad-coder/GenomeGamersFrontend)
- [Backend Repository](https://github.com/Prad-coder/GenomeGamersBackend)

### Initial Plan
[Initial Plan](http://127.0.0.1:4887/GenomeGamersFrontend/games/2025/05/06/Initial_Plan.html)

### Ideate
These new games will be fun and entertaining and add more variety to our biotech learning games.

### What is its purpose?
The purpose is to make users content and show off what games we have created using frontend and backend features.

### Source 
Main source is using our already implemented website with the biotech games and adding more games that are not completely biotech related.

### This Issue
- We will add this issue onto our website for other users to see how we designed everything for our website.
- We will add points to every game and deploy which would allow the user to not need to run the backend to receive them.
