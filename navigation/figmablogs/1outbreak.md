<h2>User Story: Predict Outbreak Scenarios</h2>

<p>As a public health strategist navigating a nationwide crisis,
I want to analyze COVID-19 vaccination and infection trends across U.S. states using real-world data,
so that I can predict where outbreaks are likely to occur and respond quickly.
By interpreting visualizations generated from machine learning forecasts (e.g., Random Forests, XGBoost), 
I can identify high-risk areas before an outbreak begins. 
When virus “bubbles” emerge on the map as indicators of potential hotspots,I must act fast to “pop” them and deploy appropriate interventions.
My goal is to reduce infection spread, minimize economic disruption, and maintain national stability — all under pressure of real-time outbreaks
modeled upon the recent devistating COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
