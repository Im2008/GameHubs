<h2>User Story: Predict Outbreak Scenarios</h2>

<p>As a public health strategist navigating a nationwide crisis,
I want to analyze COVID-19 vaccination and infection trends across U.S. states using real-world data,
so that I can predict where outbreaks are likely to occur and respond quickly.
By interpreting visualizations generated from machine learning forecasts (e.g., Random Forests, XGBoost), 
I can identify high-risk areas before an outbreak begins. 
When virus “bubbles” emerge on the map as indicators of potential hotspots,I must act fast to “pop” them and deploy appropriate interventions.
My goal is to reduce infection spread, minimize economic disruption, and maintain national stability — all under pressure of real-time outbreaks
modeled upon the recent devistating COVID-19 outbreak.</p>

<h2>User Story: DNA Building Blocks</h2>

<p>As a genomics researcher-in-training,
I want to explore and manipulate DNA sequences by selecting and swapping nucleotide blocks,
so that I can understand how mutations alter genetic code and predict their biological impact.
Using real nucleotide and mutation data from the Ensembl Genome database, I interact with a DNA strand visualized on screen.
Some base pairs are highlighted or misaligned, and I must drag and place correct or alternative blocks into those positions.
Once I finalize a sequence, machine learning models (Random Forest and XGBoost) evaluate the impact of my edits —
revealing whether the mutation is silent, harmful, or beneficial based on known patterns.
My goal is to build stable, functional DNA strands while learning how small changes in code can lead to big changes in biological outcomes.</p>
