# Game Hub
We will add 8 worlds with 3 levels each to make 24 total games in different places, rather than all on one page.

### Game Hub Frontend & Backend Repositories

### Next Plan

### Ideate
These new worlds and levels will sort and separate our games into categories making it more engaging and UI friendly.

### What is its purpose?
The purpose is to show users our different games using worlds/levels using frontend and backend features while making it not as overwhelming.

### Source 
The main source is reworking our current game hub to having 8 images & links to levels instead of 24 into their individual games.

### This Issue
- We will add this issue onto our website and search menu for other users to see how we designed everything for our website.
- We will add points to every game and deploy which would allow the user to not need to run the backend to receive them, as well as adding the levels and worlds to make the UI and design both easier to move around and assorted into groups.

### Objective
- **Make the games sorted into worlds & levels** 
- **Have fun creating them and show the requirements of making games**

### Roles For the project
- **Project Manager, Scrum Master, and Testing** - Ian Manangan
- **Frontend and Backend Developer** - Zach Peltz
- **ML Engineer and Data Science Lead** - Aarush Kota
