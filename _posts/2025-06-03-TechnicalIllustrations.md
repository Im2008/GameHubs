## 1. **Overall System Architecture**

**Architecture and Functionality:**  
*System architecture of Game Hub: The frontend (static site with interactive JS and Python) communicates with the backend API for points and user data, loads assets (such as images/audio), and interacts with the user via browser events.*

<div style="text-align:center;">

points)   Audio)   Input)

</pre>
</div>

## 2. **World Map Navigation**

**Navigation:**  
*Main Game Hub navigation: Users move with WASD, interact with world icons to talk with NPCS/enter themed worlds, can change their outfits to different game characters, and can access help options in world0 or the search menu.*

## 3. **World Entry & NPCs**

**Worlds/NPCs:**  
*World entry interaction: Approaching a world icon triggers an NPC modal with themed dialogue, Enter/Talk/Cancel options, and animated text for immersion.*

## 4. **Skin/Cosmetic Selection**

**Skins & Cosmetics:**  
*Cosmetic selection modal: Players can choose from multiple character skins, each with a points cost, and confirm their choice for in-game appearance.*

---

## 5. **Points System Integration**

**Points:**  
*Points system: The frontend fetches and displays the user's total points from the backend API, updating in real time as games are played.*

---

## 6. **Worlds and Levels**

**World Pages:**  
*World layout: Each world features a unique background, minigame entry points, and navigation elements for a unified user experience. Also there is a home icon on each world to easily get back to the home page aswell as custom audio for the worlds.*

---

## 7. **Minigame Launch Flow**

**Minigame Launch:**  
*Game Launch: Movement and collision detection when moving into the sprite of the icon triggers navigation to the minigames, with points awarded via backend integration.*

## 10. **Audio/Music Integration**

**Audio & Music:**  
*Audio integration: Each world, minigame and search menu page features a unique background song, triggered by users pressing any button. The music can be paused, muted, and fast forwarded making it adaptable based on the users needs.*
